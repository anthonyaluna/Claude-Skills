# Managed Agents — Common Client Patterns

Patterns you'll write on the client side when driving a Managed Agent session, grounded in working SDK examples.

Code samples are TypeScript — Python and cURL follow the same shape; see `python/managed-agents/README.md` and `curl/managed-agents.md` for equivalents.

## 1. Lossless stream reconnect

**Problem:** SSE has no replay. If the connection drops mid-session, a naive reconnect re-opens the stream from "now" and you silently miss every event emitted in between.

**Solution:** on reconnect, fetch the full event history via `events.list()` *before* consuming the live stream, and dedupe on event ID as the live stream catches up.

```ts
const seenEventIds = new Set<string>()
const stream = await client.beta.sessions.events.stream(session.id)

// Stream is now open and buffering server-side. Read history first.
for await (const event of client.beta.sessions.events.list(session.id)) {
  seenEventIds.add(event.id)
  handle(event)
}

// Tail the live stream. Dedupe only gates handle() — terminal checks must run
// even for already-seen events, or a terminal event that was in the history
// response gets skipped by `continue` and the loop never exits.
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (!seenEventIds.has(event.id)) {
    seenEventIds.add(event.id)
    handle(event)
  }
  if (event.type === 'session.status_terminated') break
  if (event.type === 'session.status_idle' && event.stop_reason.type !== 'requires_action') break
}
```

---

## 2. `processed_at` — queued vs processed

Every event on the stream carries `processed_at` (ISO 8601). For client-sent events (`user.message`, `user.interrupt`, `user.tool_confirmation`, `user.custom_tool_result`) it's `null` when the event has been queued but not yet picked up by the agent, and populated once the agent processes it. The same event appears on the stream twice — once with `processed_at: null`, once with a timestamp.

```ts
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === 'user.message') {
    if (event.processed_at == null) onQueued(event.id)
    else onProcessed(event.id, event.processed_at)
  }
}
```

Use this to drive pending → acknowledged UI state for anything you send. How you map a locally-rendered optimistic message to the server-assigned `event.id` is application-specific (typically via the return value of `events.send()` or FIFO ordering).

---

## 3. Interrupt a running session

Send `user.interrupt` as a normal event. The session keeps running until it reaches a safe boundary, then goes idle.

```ts
await client.beta.sessions.events.send(session.id, {
  events: [{ type: 'user.interrupt' }],
})

// Drain until the session is truly done — see Pattern 5 for the full gate.
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === 'session.status_terminated') break
  if (
    event.type === 'session.status_idle' &&
    event.stop_reason.type !== 'requires_action'
  ) break
}
```

Reference: `interrupt.ts` — sends the interrupt the moment it sees `span.model_request_start`, drains to idle, then verifies via `sessions.retrieve()`.

---

## 4. `tool_confirmation` round-trip

When the agent has `permission_policy: { type: 'always_ask' }`, a call fires an `agent.tool_use` or `agent.mcp_tool_use` event with `evaluated_permission === 'ask'`. Review the originating agent/thread, exact tool, and full input before responding. `confirmToolUse` below is application-owned: it must return `true` only after explicit operator approval (or a strict, pre-reviewed allowlist match). The example enforces a 30-second timeout; missing review, errors, timeouts, and unknown decisions deny by default.

```ts
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (
    (event.type === 'agent.tool_use' || event.type === 'agent.mcp_tool_use') &&
    event.evaluated_permission === 'ask'
  ) {
    const reviewTimeout = Symbol('review_timeout')
    let timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | undefined
    const decision = await Promise.race([
      confirmToolUse(event).catch(() => false),
      new Promise<typeof reviewTimeout>((resolve) => {
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => resolve(reviewTimeout), 30_000)
      }),
    ]).finally(() => {
      if (timeoutId !== undefined) clearTimeout(timeoutId)
    })
    const approved = decision === true

    await client.beta.sessions.events.send(session.id, {
      events: [{
        type: 'user.tool_confirmation',
        tool_use_id: event.id,         // not a toolu_ id — use event.id
        result: approved ? 'allow' : 'deny',
        ...(!approved ? { deny_message: 'Not approved by operator.' } : {}),
      }],
    })
  }
}
```

`confirmToolUse(event)` is a placeholder for your application's review flow, not an SDK method. It must render the full request to the operator and ignore late results after the timeout. Never resolve a pending event to `allow` merely because it exists or because the stream resumed.

Key points:
- `tool_use_id` is `event.id` (typically `sevt_...`), **not** a `toolu_...` ID.
- `result` is `'allow' | 'deny'`. Use `deny_message` to tell the model *why* you denied — it gets surfaced back to the agent.
- Multiple pending tools: respond once per `agent.tool_use` or `agent.mcp_tool_use` event with `evaluated_permission === 'ask'`.

Reference: `tool-permissions.ts`.

## 5. Correct idle-break gate

Do not break on `session.status_idle` alone. The session goes idle transiently — e.g. between parallel tool executions, while waiting for a `user.tool_confirmation`, or while awaiting a `user.custom_tool_result`. Break when idle with a terminal `stop_reason`, or on `session.status_terminated`.

```ts
for await (const event of stream) {
  handle(event)
  if (event.type === 'session.status_terminated') break
  if (event.type === 'session.status_idle') {
    if (event.stop_reason.type === 'requires_action') continue // waiting on you — handle it
    break // end_turn or retries_exhausted — both terminal
  }
}
```

`stop_reason.type` values on `session.status_idle`:
- `requires_action` — agent is waiting on a client-side event (tool confirmation, custom tool result). Handle it, don't break.
- `retries_exhausted` — terminal failure. Break, then check `sessions.retrieve()` for the error state.
- `end_turn` — normal completion.

---

## 6. Post-idle status-write race

The SSE stream emits `session.status_idle` slightly before the session's queryable status reflects it. Clients that break on idle and immediately call `sessions.delete()` or `sessions.archive()` will intermittently 400 with "cannot delete/archive while running."

Poll before cleanup:

```ts
let s
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  s = await client.beta.sessions.retrieve(session.id)
  if (s.status !== 'running') break
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 200))
}
if (s?.status !== 'running') {
  await client.beta.sessions.archive(session.id)
} // else: still running after 2s — don't archive, let it settle or escalate
```

---

## 7. Stream-first, then send

Always open the stream **before** sending the kickoff event. Otherwise the agent may process the event and emit the first events before your consumer is attached, and you'll miss them.

```ts
const stream = await client.beta.sessions.events.stream(session.id)
await client.beta.sessions.events.send(session.id, {
  events: [{ type: 'user.message', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello' }] }],
})
for await (const event of stream) { /* ... */ }
```

The `Promise.all([stream, send])` shape works too, but stream-first is simpler and has the same effect — the stream starts buffering the moment it's opened.

---

## 8. File-mount gotchas

**The mounted resource has a different `file_id` than the file you uploaded.** Session creation makes a session-scoped copy.

```ts
const uploaded = await client.beta.files.upload({ file })
// uploaded.id         → the original file
const session = await client.beta.sessions.create({
  /* ... */
  resources: [{ type: 'file', file_id: uploaded.id, mount_path: '/workspace/data.csv' }],
})
// session.resources[0].file_id !== uploaded.id  ← different IDs
```

Delete the original via `files.delete(uploaded.id)`; the session-scoped copy is garbage-collected with the session. `mount_path` must be absolute — see `shared/managed-agents-environments.md`.

---

## 9. Secrets for non-MCP APIs and CLIs — keep them host-side via custom tools

**Problem:** you want the agent to call a third-party API or run a CLI that needs a secret (API key, token, service-account credential), but there is currently no way to set environment variables inside the session container, and vaults currently hold MCP credentials only — they are not exposed to the container's shell. So `curl`, installed CLIs, or SDK clients running via the `bash` tool have no first-class place to read a secret from.

**Solution:** move a narrowly scoped, application-authorized operation to your side. Declare an operation-specific custom tool on the agent; when the agent emits `agent.custom_tool_use`, your orchestrator validates and authorizes its input, executes only that fixed operation with its own credentials, minimizes the returned fields, and responds with `user.custom_tool_result`. The container never sees the key. Custom-tool inputs are model-controlled, so do not forward raw query text, URLs, shell commands, or other unrestricted operation selectors to a privileged client.

```ts
// Agent template: expose one read-only operation, no credentials
tools: [{
  type: 'custom',
  name: 'linear_issue_lookup',
  input_schema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: { issue_id: { type: 'string' } },
    required: ['issue_id'],
    additionalProperties: false,
  },
}]

// Orchestrator: handle the call with host-side creds
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === 'agent.custom_tool_use' && event.name === 'linear_issue_lookup') {
    // App-owned adapter validates the ID, checks caller/resource access, uses a
    // fixed read-only SDK operation, and returns only an allowlisted projection.
    const result = await authorizedLinearIssueLookup(event.input.issue_id)
    await client.beta.sessions.events.send(session.id, {
      events: [{
        type: 'user.custom_tool_result',
        custom_tool_use_id: event.id,
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result) }],
      }],
    })
  }
}
```

Same shape works for `gh` CLI, local eval scripts, or anything else that needs host-side auth or binaries.

Do not turn this into a generic `graphql(query, variables)` tool. For any write capability, define a separate fixed-purpose operation with least-privilege credentials and a separate explicit authorization/confirmation step; never let model-controlled query text select mutations.

**Security note:** this does not expose a public endpoint. `agent.custom_tool_use` arrives on the SSE stream your orchestrator already holds open with your Anthropic API key, and `user.custom_tool_result` goes back via `events.send()` under the same key. Your orchestrator is a client, not a server — nothing unauthenticated is listening.

**Do not embed API keys in the system prompt or user messages as a workaround.** Prompts and messages are stored in the session's event history, returned by `events.list()`, and included in compaction summaries — a secret placed there is durably persisted and readable via the API for the life of the session.
